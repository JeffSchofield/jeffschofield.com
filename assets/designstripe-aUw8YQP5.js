experience, processing times, and output quality.","Developed and refined a novel procedural graphic design generation system using React, SVG filters, and WebGL that combines constraint satisfaction and wave-function collapse principles, as well as a visual and code editor with an AI co-pilot, while collaborating closely with graphic designers to translate creative visions into scalable, brand-consistent visual assets and intelligent React components.","Engineered specialized features - including a brand analysis system, a server-side 3D video renderer, a server side 2D graphic design renderer, and an advanced image processing pipeline for both raster images and SVG assets, designed to improve responsiveness, asset quality, and performance.","Architected scalable backend systems with container orchestration and serverless functions to support critical business flows, implementing a modern authentication system and secure subscription and checkout system using Stripe and Auth0.","Led major refactoring initiatives that decomposed a monolithic codebase into modular libraries for both React and NestJS, clarifying code ownership and optimizing CI/CD pipelines for developer productivity gains.","Championed cross-functional collaboration to align technical strategies with business objectives and ensure system scalability and reliability."],achievements:[{title:"Frontend Development",items:["Built a variety of complex React pages and component architectures leveraging low-level browser APIs where appropriate, including efficient infinite scrolling design generation results page with lazy loading, SVG spritesheets, and image srcset support; multi-step form wizards for onboarding and managing customer brands; and visual editors with realtime progress feedback for long-running processes like server-side video rendering.","Implemented a gamut of React state management patterns including context providers, jotai atoms, Redux, and Preact signals, as well as server-side state synchronization tools like SWR, TanStack Query, GraphQL via Apollo and URQL, and tRPC, using Suspense to display loading skeletons.","Developed a subscription-based authorization and paywall system using React and integrated in Next.JS, directly contributing to revenue growth and customer satisfaction.","Engineered reusable React components and hooks for font processing features, including custom font loading, fitting, and whitespace trimming, ensuring precise rendering of user-provided fonts in both the design editor and the application as a whole.","Created a WebGL-based shader effects system integrated with React components, enabling dynamic visual effects and animations without the overhead of a full 3D context."]},{title:"Backend Development",items:["Architected and developed service-oriented backend systems with Node.js and Python, including event processing pipeline in NestJS that managed concurrent workflow execution through a combination of pub/sub messaging patterns and idempotent operations, ensuring data consistency across distributed services even during partial system failures.","Built robust authentication and subscription checkout systems in NestJS using Auth0, Stripe, HookDeck for Web Hook management, and MongoDB, resulting in secure and seamless user transactions with immediate feedback in the app.","Implemented real-time communication techniques between React and NestJS including polling, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events to provide immediate feedback and updates to users interacting with long-running jobs and AI systems.","Managed cross-language integration between C++, Python, and Node.js services, ensuring high availability, traceability, and uptime monitoring.","Created multi-stage Dockerfiles for C++, Python, and Node.js server applications, being careful to avoid bloating with unnecessary files like sourcecode and build artifacts, and including the ability to use them as developer containers for easy portable dependency management."]},{title:"System Architecture & DevOps",items:["Established testing architecture using Vitest and Happy DOM, Cypress for E2E testing, and a custom visual regression testing framework for generative graphic designs.","Managed a multi-language, multi-framework NX
