With it comes a shift in how designers should think about spacing. The core idea is to reason in ratios and fractions instead of absolute measurements such as pixels. The only absolute unit in Gridlines is the base grid cell size that underlies your design.",-1),c=e("p",null,"This is equivalent to the \u201C1cm\u201D of 1cm graph paper. If you scale 1cm to 2cm, the rest of your UI sans text elements will scale as well, including borders and border radii.
